# Echo UDP

Simple UDP client-server communication system.

UDPClient:
The UDPClient class represents the client side. When executed, it prompts the user for a message input, sends the message as a UDP packet to a specified server address and port, waits for a response from the server, and then displays the received message.

UDPServer:
The UDPServer class represents the server side. When executed, it listens on a designated port for incoming UDP packets. Upon receiving a packet, it converts the enclosed message to uppercase, sends the modified message back to the client, and effectively mirrors the client's message in uppercase.

In essence, the UDPClient sends a message to the UDPServer, which responds with the same message converted to uppercase. This showcases a basic application of UDP communication between a client and a server. However, keep in mind that UDP lacks guarantees for reliable delivery and order preservation, making it more suitable for scenarios where speed is prioritized over data integrity.
